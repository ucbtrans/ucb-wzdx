    :alt: Build

``polyline`` is a Python implementation of Google's `Encoded Polyline Algorithm
Format <https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm>`__. It is essentially a port of `Mapbox polyline <https://github.com/mapbox/polyline>`__ with some additional features.
Source: `https://github.com/frederickjansen/polyline` 

Installation
------------

``polyline`` can be installed using ``pip``::

    $ pip install polyline

Starting from ``v2.0.0`` only Python 3.7 and above is supported. For Python 2 support, please install ``v1.4.0``::

    $ pip install polyline==1.4.0

API Documentation
-----------------

Encoding
^^^^^^^^

To get the encoded polyline representation of a given set of (lat, lon) coordinates::

    import polyline
    polyline.encode([(38.5, -120.2), (40.7, -120.9), (43.2, -126.4)], 5)

This should return ``_p~iF~ps|U_ulL~ugC_hgN~eq`@``.

You can set the required precision with the optional ``precision`` parameter. The default value is 5.

You can encode (lon, lat) tuples by setting ``geojson=True``.

Decoding
^^^^^^^^

To get a set of coordinates represented by a given encoded polyline string::

    import polyline
    polyline.decode('u{~vFvyys@fS]', 5)

This should return ``[(40.63179, -8.65708), (40.62855, -8.65693)]`` in (lat, lon) order.

You can set the required precision with the optional ``precision`` parameter. The default value is 5.

You can decode into (lon, lat) tuples by setting ``geojson=True``.


Development
-----------
All installation and development dependencies are fully specified in ``pyproject.toml``. The ``project.optional-dependencies`` object is used to `specify optional requirements <https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/pyproject_config.html>`__ for various development tasks. This makes it possible to specify additional options when performing installation using ``pip``::

    python -m pip install .[dev]

Documentation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The documentation can be generated automatically from the source files using `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org>`__::

    python -m sphinx.cmd.build -b html docs docs/_build/html

Testing and Conventions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
All unit tests are executed and their coverage is measured when using `pytest <https://docs.pytest.org>`__::

    python -m pytest

Style conventions are enforced using `Pylint <https://pylint.pycqa.org>`__::

    python -m pylint polyline

    git tag ?.?.?
    git push origin ?.?.?

Remove any old build/distribution files. Then, package the source into a distribution archive::

    rm -rf build dist src/*.egg-info
    python -m build --sdist --wheel .

Finally, upload the package distribution archive to `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`__::

    python -m twine upload dist/*
